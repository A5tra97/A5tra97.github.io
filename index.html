      <h1>A Short Biography</h1>
      <p>Autumn Astra Palm was born in Portland Victoria on the 9th of December 2002. From early childhood I was interested in solving puzzles and building things.
        Most of my time as a kid was spent building Lego and reading, though later in my teenage years it evolved into software and robotics. <br><br>

        My childhood was rough, I didn't live with my parents since I had been placed in care with my nan because I was found covered in bruises at a few weeks old.
        I grew up blaming myself for this, for my dad not seeing me anymore, for the bullying I endured everyday and the fact I never seemed to fit in. Life inside
        the Jehovah's witnesses was no better, I was the kind of kid who questioned everything, and that kind of person doesn't blend well in cults. It was around 2017 when
        my dad died and I started to learn new things about myself. This lead to a very rough few years of leaving the cult I was raised in, questioning my reality,
        my identity. Eventually I ran away from my nan to live with my aunt and cousins, the abuse at home was getting too difficult to handle, especially with the
        new realisations about myself. <br><br>

        It led to a rough year, I cam out as trans, started transitioning, struggled with facing alot of my childhood trauma, including learning that my dad had stopped
        visiting me as a kid because of my nan, and not me, like I was told. I made my first realy friends and started actually finding myself and taking steps towards
        being able to have the life and career that I want. <br>
